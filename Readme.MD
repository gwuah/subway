# Subway üöÖ
Subway is a layer-3(IP) tunneling sofware. It routes all your internet traffic through an exit-node, just like how traditional vpns work, except this time, you own the exit node. 

# Map
- demo - contains a simple tcp proxy that communicates over the tunnel.
- docs - contains notes accumulated from working on this project.
- node - contains the tunneling software.
- test - contains shell scripts and other config files for testing.

# How to use
- Run `make build` in the root repo
- On the machine whose traffic you want to tunnel, run `make run-client` 
- On the exit node, run `make run-server`
- And you should have your own private network pipes on the internet!  üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

# Architecture
Here's the architecture of the client node  
![[client architecture](https://lxd.me/a-simple-vpn-tunnel-with-tun-device-demo-and-some-basic-concepts)](./docs/tunc.png)

The server is pretty much a reverse of the client. 
- Traffic arrives at the udp socket.
- We write it to the tun0 virtual interface. 
- The kernel sees our original packet & since ip forwarding is turned on, it forwards the packet to the next hop router/gateway.
- Right before the packets exits the kernel, we perform network address translation on the source IP on the packet so the internet can route a reply back home.


# Notes
- It only works on linux - mainly because the tuntap library I'm using only works on linux.
- It's not very secure - i wrote this software to solidify some networking knowledge, it's not production software.
- It's not very efficient - i wrote this software to solidify some networking knowledge, it's not production software.
